## Basic Homepage Layout - 13%

***

In this assignment, we will make use of all the layout techniques we learned about in the layout section and the practical sections. Your job is to make a home page that has the following:

1. A header. It should have a font awesome icon as the 'company logo', and 4 navigation links (they dont need to be hooked up to anything)
2. A hero section with an unsplash pic as the background. (use a gradient if you want to go the extra mile)
3. A footer with font awesome social media icon links
4. Everything should be responsive

What I will be giving marks for:
1. Is the HTML and CSS properly indented
2. Can I see a hamburger menu at some point when I size down the browser width to phone width
3. Is the CSS files, google fonts, img file properly linked
4. Is there social media icons in the footer
5. Is there a hero section with an image
